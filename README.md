# Individual-Self-Assessment

For the project my main role was to work with the machine learning model, which was an extremely sensitive role in the project, therefore my role was to first check if logistic regression works and is suitable for our project and half way through we realized that we have more two outcomes, therefore we don’t have a binary outcome which forced us to shift to multiclass logistic regression which is we haven’t covered in the bootcamp this caused me to read and learn more about new concepts which was very challenging due to my limited time as a senior student at Penn State University. Peer reviews were very constrictive and even though we haven’t done the multiclass logistic regression successfully with the help of my team members we have done neural networks ML model which worked with accuracy above 80% which is truly impressive as it was the first draft. Almost towards the end we lost a team member who had control over the GitHub page we have set up for the final project which caused us a lot of stress since we couldn’t get in contact with him, and we had to create a new site to host our project. We used Slack and text messages to contact each other and hosted few meetings via Zoom to discuss our progress in the final project. For our project we estimated the risk of skin mole being cancerous or not which was a very interesting topic and informative at the same time, where we used neural networks to classify thousands of mole images into low, medium, or high risk and based on that recommend if a medical follow-up is required or not. Our results me not have the highest accuracy, therefore we need to try and train the data with other machine learning models to achieve higher accuracy as this can be used for medical purposes where the accuracy of the outcomes must be high as people lives can be at risk. Overall, I truly enjoyed my experience in the bootcamp and all the new concepts I had the opportunity to learn.
